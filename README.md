# kaggle-titanic
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

#The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

#my code runs in top 3% in the end, even though the competetion ended, but it was a great expereince to learn data science through kaggle.
